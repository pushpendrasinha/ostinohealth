        <p>We took time out to figure key reasons for new executive failure through interactions, interviews and published literature. The outcome was that new executives generally fail due to five key reasons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Cultural fitment.</li>
          <li>Teamwork with staff and peers.</li>
          <li>Unclear expectations about performance.</li>
          <li>Political savviness.</li>
          <li>Lack of a strategic and formal assimilation process.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional insight garnered in an Indian context was that some organizations do not emphasize onboarding of new executives as they wish to avoid offending existing professionals, who may perceive such program as hint of capability gaps. Research indicates that onboarding programs may be more critical as they face much higher performance expectations with a greater impact on the overall performance of the organization.</p>
        <p>Recruitment and onboarding of new senior leaders – be it through internal promotion or external selection – should not be taken lightly. Proper planning with execution is the key.</p>

        <li value="4">Organization structure design
            <p>Design organization structure aligned to your business and operating model. In an earlier era, organization design meant restructuring to achieve cost efficiencies. Today, organization design is more to do with identifying cost efficiencies and allocating resources to drive growth and efficiency across various levels. <br>
            Even with the shift the fundamentals remain unchanged, and that is, supporting a leader to move from defining strategy to putting in place an organization that enables execution of the strategy.</p>
