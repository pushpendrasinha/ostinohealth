  <p>Ostino partners with Central and various State Governments on structuring, mining and leveraging analytics to wring out insights. We will work with you to improve results, lower costs, answer new
    questions improved engagement with the public and make better decisions.</p>

  <p>The reality is that large scale data, so-called Big data, enhances the criticality of procuring insights. Big data comprises of both structured and unstructured data sets whose size and complexity are well above the ability of commonly used software for capturing, processing or managing.</p>

  <p>We bring a single point ownership approach towards your data from legacy transactional systems to ERP systems to web data, sensors data, cyber data, cloud computing, Hadoop / Map-Reduce environments, text data and other data types.</p>


  <p>Listed below are the pointers we frequently hear in Government Departments / Ministries.</p>

  <p>Wondering whether expenses have been optimally used or can there be savings without compromising on quality? </p>

  <p>Received my budget and wondering how to analyse historical data for insights. Is it doable in a distributed software environment?</p>

  <p>Do I have the ability to do more with less basis understanding of spends and impact?
  </p>

  <p>I am inundated with data with fatigue settling in my department. How can I structure it for relevance?</p>

  <p>I do not understand data - mining - analytics although identify with the issues. Where / How do I educate myself?</p>

  <p>If the above points sound familiar, you have come to the right page. </p>
