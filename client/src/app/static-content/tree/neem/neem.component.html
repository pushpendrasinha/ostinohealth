  <h2>NEEM TREE (Scientific Name: Azadirachta indica)</h2>

  <p>  It is a tall evergreen tree upto 100 feet tall, with small bright green leaves. It blossoms in spring with small white flowers. The greyish â€“ brown bark is hard, rough and scaly, fissured even in small trees. The leaves are alternate and consists of several leaflets with serrated edges. The fruit is oval, round and thin skinned.  </p>

  <p>The neem tree is noted for its drought resistance. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall of 400-1,200 millimetres (16-47 in). It can grow in regions with an annual rainfall below 400 mm, but in such cases,  it depends largely on ground water levels. Neem can grow in many different types of soil, but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils. It is a typical tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures of 21-32 'C (70-90 'F). It can tolerate high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below 4 'C (39 'F). Neem is one of a very few shade-giving trees that thrive in drought-prone areas e.g. the dry coastal, southern districts of India, and Pakistan. The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle of water, whatever the quality. In India and tropical countries where the Indian diaspora has reached, it is very common to see neem trees used for shade lining streets, around temples, schools and other such public buildings or in most people's back yards. In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of land.</p>

  <h3>Uses </h3>
  <p>Neem leaves are dried in India and placed in cupboards to prevent insects eating the clothes, and also in tins where rice is stored. Neem leaves are dried and burnt in the tropical regions to keep away mosquitoes. These flowers are also used in many Indian festivals like Ugadi.  </p>

  <p><b>As vegetable</b> The tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India. A souplike dish called Veppampoo charu (Tamil) (translated as "neem flower rasam") made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu. In Bengal, young neem leaves are fried in oil with tiny pieces of eggplant (brinjal). The dish is called nim begun and is the first item during a Bengali meal that acts as an appetizer. It is eaten with rice.  </p>

  <p> <b>Traditional Medicines </b> Each part of neem is used in traditional medicines. It has been used in Ayurvedic medicines for more than thousands of years. Neem oil extracted from its seeds is used in medicines, pest control and cosmetics etc. Its leaves are used in the treatment of Chickenpox. According to the Hindu religion, the Goddess of Chickenpox, Sithala devi, lives in the Neem tree. Neem tea is usually taken to reduce the headache and fever. Its flowers are used to cure intestinal problems. Neem bark acts as an analgesic and can cure high fever. Even the skin diseases can be cured from the Neem leaves. </p>

  <p>Neem is a key ingredient in <b> non-pesticidal management </b>(NPM), providing a natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. Neem seeds are ground into a powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop. To be effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem does not directly kill insects on the crop. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent, protecting the crop from damage. The insects starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs. Neem-based fertilizeres have been effective against the pest southern armyworm. Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer. </p>

  <p><b>Neem oil </b>has been shown to avert termite attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent. </p>

  <h3> Neem oil for polymeric resins</h3>
  <p>Applications of neem oil in the preparation of polymeric resins have been documented in the recent reports. The synthesis of various alkyd resins from neem oil is reported using a monoglyceride (MG) route and their utilization for the preparation of PU coatings. The alkyds are prepared from reaction of conventional divalent acid materials like phthalic and maleic anhydrides with MG of neem oil. In other reports, different routes for preparation of polymeric resins from neem oil also are reported.</p>

  <p><b>Toiletries:</b> Neem oil is used for preparing cosmetics such as soap, shampoo, balms, and creams as well as toothpaste.</p>

  <p><b>Toothbrush:</b> Traditionally, slender neem twigs (called datun) are first chewed as a toothbrush and then split as a tongue cleaner. This practice has been in use in India, Africa, and the Middle East for centuries. It is still used in India's rural areas. Neem twigs are still collected and sold in rural markets for this use. It has been found to be as effective as a toothbrush in reducing plaque and gingival inflammation.</p>

  <p><b>Tree:</b> Besides its use in traditional Indian medicine, the neem tree is of great importance for its anti-desertification properties and possibly as a good carbon dioxide sink. </p>

  <p><b>Cosmetics: </b>Neem is perceived in India as a beauty aid. Powdered leaves are a major component of at least one widely used facial cream. Purified neem oil is also used in nail polish and other cosmetics.</p>

  <p><b>Bird repellent: </b> Neem leaf boiled in water can be used as a very cost-effective bird repellent, especially for sparrows. <br>
    <b>Bark: </b> Neem bark contains 14% tannin, an amount similar to that in conventional tannin-yielding trees (such as Acacia decurrens). Moreover, it yields a strong, coarse fibre commonly woven into ropes in the villages of India.<br>
    <b>Soap:</b> 80% of India's supply of neem oil now is used by neem oil soap manufacturers. Although much of it goes to small-scale speciality soaps, often using cold-pressed oil, large-scale producers also use it, mainly because it is cheap. Additionally it is antibacterial and antifungal, soothing, and moisturising. It can be made with up to 40% neem oil. Generally, the crude oil is used to produce coarse laundry soaps.</p>

  <h3>Chemical Compounds </h3>
  <p> Ayurveda was the first to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the neem tree to the attention of natural products chemists. The process of extracting neem oil involves extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate, and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205 'C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192 'C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90-100 'C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil. These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.<br>
    Neem-coated urea is being used an alternate to plain urea fertilizer in India. It reduces pollution, improves fertilizer's efficacy and soil health. </p>

  <h3>Enlightenment</h3>
  <p>Traditional and cultural applications of Neem are immense. In Theravada Buddhism, the neem tree is said to have been used to achieve enlightenment (bodhi) by Tissa, the twentieth Lord Buddha. The name "Nimai", a reference to this legend, means "of the neem tree" and trends at 5-10 babies per million. </p>

  <h3>Hindu Festivals</h3>
  <p>Neem leaf or bark is considered an effective pitta pacifier because of its bitter taste. Hence, it is traditionally recommended during early summer in Ayurveda. <br>
    <i>Note: Pitta is linked to Ayurveda wherein it governs all heat, metabolism and transformation in the mind and body. Pitta governs the important digestive "agnis" or fires of the body.</i>

  <p>In the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, Neem flowers are very popular for their use in 'Ugadi Pachhadi' (soup-like pickle), which is made on Ugadi day. In Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana, a small amount of Neem and Jaggery (Bevu-Bella) is consumed on Ugadi day, the Telugu and Kannada new year, indicating that one should take both bitter and sweet things in life, joy and sorrow.</p>

  <p> During Gudi Padva, which is the New Year in the state of Maharashtra, the ancient practice of drinking a small quantity of neem juice or paste on that day, before starting festivities, is found. As in many Hindu festivals and their association with some food to avoid negative side-effects of the season or change of seasons, neem juice is associated with Gudi Padva to remind people to use it during that particular month or season to pacify summer pitta.</p>

  <p>In Tamil Nadu during the summer months of April to June, the Mariamman temple festival is a thousand-year-old tradition. The Neem leaves and flowers are the most important part of the Mariamman festival. The statue of the goddess Mariamman will be garlanded with Neem leaves and flowers. During most occasions of celebrations and weddings the people of Tamil Nadu adorn their surroundings with the Neem leaves and flowers as a form of decoration and also to ward off evil spirits and infections.</p>

  <p>In the eastern coastal state of Odisha the famous Jagannath temple deities are made up of Neem heart wood along with some other essential oils and powders.</p>

  <h3>Genome </h3>
  <p>Neem genome and transcriptomes from various organs have been sequenced, lavouri, and published by Ganit Labs in Bangalore, India.</p>

  <h3>Patent Disputes</h3>
  <p>In 1995, the European Patent Office (EPO) granted a patent on an anti-fungal product derived from neem to the United States Department of Agriculture and W. R. Grace and Company. The Indian government challenged the patent when it was granted, claiming that the process for which the patent had been granted had been in use in India for more than 2,000 years. In 2000, the EPO ruled in India's favour, but W. R. Grace appealed, claiming that prior art about the product had never been published in a scientific journal. On 8 March 2005, that appeal was lost and the EPO revoked the Neem patent. </p>
